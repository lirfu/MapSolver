# MapSolver
Cool game of building a labyrinth for the bot to solve.
The more complex the map is, longer it takes the bot to solve it. 

## The goal
Keep the bot searching for as long as possible.

## Not cool enough?
The game itself might not be interesting on its own,however it has a interesting use.
The bot itself is modeled to accept different implementations of controllers, so you can build your own controller using AI and test it.
